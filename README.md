# README Generator
## Description 
This README generator will take the user's answers from a series of questions about the README and generate it on a new file accordingly. It goes over all the sections of a professional README and creates an easier alternative to form a readme without having to divide each section manually. Throughout this  project, I learned that backend  development is just as hard as frontend and that coding itself takes a lot of time and commitment to fully understand.
